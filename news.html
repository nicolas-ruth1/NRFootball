                <h1 class="titles">Ronaldo frustration!</h1>
                <p>During the game against Tottenham, Manchester United player Cristiano Ronaldo turned violent as he
                    kicked Sergio Reguilon in the stomach in frustration. This is believed to be down to the team's
                    performance in recent games, as they've simply been subpar. The title race is considered to now be
                    over for Manchester United, which angers the portuguese forward. In his interview he clearly stated
                    that he came back to Manchester to win trophies and bring the club back to where they are supposed
                    to be. Yet, when he arrived the team's bad run of form continued.</p>

                <h1 class="titles">Martial transfer desires!</h1>
                <p>Regarding recent form, Manchester United forward Anthony Martial has been dropped from the starting
                    XI. This has resulted in an upset between Martial's agent and the club. Anthony expressed his
                    unhappiness at United and wishes to leave the club during the January transfer window. Many top
                    teams across Europe are monitoring his situation. Due to Martial's high wage demands, Manchester
                    United are unwilling to offer him a new contract, and since it's running out and he's on bad form,
                    both parties think it's best to part ways.</p>

                <h1 class="titles">Kun Aguero announces retirement!</h1>
                <p>Devastated Sergio Kun Aguero breaks down in tears before he can even start to announce his
                    retirement, aged 33, at a special ceremony, after doctors told Man City legend to quit over
                    irregular heartbeat. This is a terrible upset to most football fans, as Aguero was one of a kind,
                    the best at what he did.</p>

                <h1 class="titles">Donny van de Beek announces pregnancy!</h1>
                <p>Amazing time for Manchester United player Donny van de Beek as he announces his first child, which is
                    going to be a baby girl. Though the United player has not been so lucky on the pitch regarding
                    playing time, he's a happy man off the pitch. Some could even say maybe his luck has turned around,
                    as teammate Paul Pogba is considered to be seriously injured. This means Donny is in the mix for the
                    starting position. Time will tell.</p>
